        res.reply "In a purple galaxy, in a purple solar system, orbiting a purple star, there is a purple planet. On this purple planet (called Purplearth) there is a purple kingdom call Purpledonia. Purpledonia is ruled by the purple king Purplias Maximus the Purpley One who rules with a purple, but fair, hand. One day Purpledonia was attacked by the most purple and evil of all purple dragons. During this despicable attack the purple dragon kidnapped the pruple princess Purplia and took her for his own evil intentions. After the purple dust had settled the purple king, purple with rage, called forth his best and bravest (and handsomest) purple knight. \"Purple knight\", he said, \"Take your brave purple steed and return to me my purple princess Purplia\" The brave (and handsome) purple knight bowed low and said \"Purple king Purplias Maximus, I will take this most purple of tasks and rescue the purple princess Purplia from the purple dragon\""
